BikeStore Data Analysis and Dashboard

Welcome to the BikeStore Data Analysis and Dashboard project! In this repository, we analyze bike sales data using SQL, Excel, and Tableau to derive insights and create interactive dashboards for visualization.

Overview:

The BikeStore dataset contains information about bike sales, including customer demographics, product details, and sales transactions. Our objective is to analyze this data using SQL for data manipulation and aggregation, Excel for in-depth analysis and calculations, and Tableau for creating interactive dashboards to visualize the findings.

Contents:

Data: This folder contains the raw data files used in the analysis, including CSV files for sales, customers, products, and more.
SQL Scripts: This folder contains SQL scripts used to query and manipulate the dataset. These scripts are used to perform data cleaning, aggregation, and transformation tasks.
Excel Analysis: This folder contains Excel workbooks where we perform detailed analysis and calculations on the dataset. This includes pivot tables, formulas, and charts to gain insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.
Tableau Dashboard: This folder contains the Tableau workbook where we create an interactive dashboard to visualize the key findings from the analysis. The dashboard includes various charts, filters, and interactive elements to explore the data dynamically.
Analysis Process:

SQL Analysis: We start by querying the dataset using SQL to perform data cleaning, aggregation, and transformation tasks. This includes joining tables, filtering data, and calculating metrics such as total sales and average revenue.
Excel Analysis: We import the cleaned dataset into Excel and perform in-depth analysis using pivot tables, formulas, and charts. This includes analyzing sales by region, product category, customer segment, and more.
Tableau Dashboard Creation: We import the cleaned dataset into Tableau and create an interactive dashboard to visualize the key findings from the analysis. This includes creating charts such as bar charts, line charts, and maps, and adding filters and parameters for interactivity.

Thank you for your interest in the BikeStore Data Analysis and Dashboard project! We hope you find the insights generated from this analysis valuable and informative.

Happy analyzing!
